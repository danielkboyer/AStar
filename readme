Modified A* algorithm that only allows the agent to move forwards and backwards with diagonals (so the agent cannot move left and right)
If no solution exists "No solution" is displayed
Original code is from https://medium.com/@nicholas.w.swift/easy-a-star-pathfinding-7e6689c7f7b2

Changes
1. Added direction class that has 8 different directions
2. Added direction class to Node class specifying a node in a position in a direction
3. modified node equals method to include direction
4. Fixed bug in original code for continuing when node has already been visited
(before the fix, it would continue but in the incorrect loop, this happened in two different places, so it ran forever)
5. Modified path print to include direction
6. printed map with the path of the car and the direction it was headed in
